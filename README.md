# CoDa-analysis-Pig-farms
In this project, we employed metagenomic methodologies to explore both the taxonomy in the samples and the presence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in four samples obtained from pig farms in Netherland and Denmark. Each sample represents a composite of fecal material from 25 pigs belonging to a single farm.

## Methods
Quality control - FastQC \n
Trimming - BBduk / fastp
AMR genes detection - ResFinder
De-Novo assemply - MetaSPades
Binning - Metabat2
Bin quality - CheckM + dRep
Taxonomy assignment - GTDB-tk
